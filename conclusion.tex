\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we first identify the overlooked problemâ€“uncertain graph anonymization. Then, we develop a new scheme, {\methodName}, which seamlessly integrates edge uncertainty into the core of the anonymization process such as the evaluation of privacy risk, utility loss, and judicious stochastic modifications. Experiments on three real-world datasets verify its effectiveness. In real-world graphs, edge probabilities sometimes are not independent, but dependent. Thus, we plan to extend our scheme to handle uncertain graphs with dependent probabilities. It is also interesting to investigate sharing uncertain graphs in the differentially private manner.
