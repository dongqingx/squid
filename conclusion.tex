\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we study the problem of developing a flexible \emph{uncertain} graph privacy scheme that preserves graph structure while providing the user-specified level of privacy guarantee. First, we introduce the Rep-An scheme that aims these goals using the representative instance as an approximation of \emph{uncertain} graph and show it requires addition of high levels of noise to obtain privacy guarantee. 
Second, we develop {\SysNameNS} approaches that seamlessly integrate edge uncertainty into the core of the
anonymization process such as the evaluation of privacy risk, utility loss and judicious uncertain graph modifications. 
We present a new utility-loss metric based on the solid connectivity-based graph model under the possible world semantics, namely the reliability discrepancy. Moreover, we introduce the reliability-sensitive edge selection strategy (RS) and max-entropy edge perturbation (ME) strategy for better utility preserving. 
Experimental studies on different real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach can anonymize uncertain graphs to the desired anonymity level with at a slight cost of utility, better than {Rep-An}.
