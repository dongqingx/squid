\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we first identify the overlooked problemâ€“uncertain graph anonymization. 
We develop a new scheme, Squid, which integrates edge uncertainty into the core. 
It excels in identifying sanitized uncertain graphs with excellent quality. 
Experiments on three real-world datasets verify its effectiveness. 
In real-world graphs, edge probabilities sometimes are not independent, but dependent.  We leave the conditional probability model as a future extension. 
Another extension is to investigate sharing uncertain graphs in the differentially private manner.
