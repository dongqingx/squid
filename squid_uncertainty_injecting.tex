\subsection{The stochastic uncertainty injecting scheme}
For each sampled edge $e$ with the distributed standard deviation $\sigma_{e}$, we select the probability deviation $r_{e}$ where $r_{e} \leftarrow R_{\sigma_{e}}$. Thus, we are left asking the question, \emph{how can we safely alter edge probability for higher anonymity?}


It is quite straightforward in the deterministic scenario, as outlined in Eq~\ref{eq:inject}. It is far more difficult in the uncertain scenario. A naive scheme is to inject uncertainty in a randomized way regardless of its initial existence probability. However, the randomized scheme is far from the optimal.
