\section{Privacy Via {\methodName}}
In this section we describe our algorithm, {\methodName}, which injects uncertainty to the given uncertain graph so that it becomes {\keobf} while preserving as much the stochastic nature as possible. The key feature is to seamless integrate edge uncertainty and possible world semantics into the core of anonymization operators.
