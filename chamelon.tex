\section{Privacy Via {\methodName}}

We propose a approach for the \textsc{Uncertain graph anonymization} problem. Instead of casting/disregarding uncertainty, we seamlessly integrate possible world semantics into the core of the state-of-art anonymization algorithm. It enables grained and judicious control over noise subject to uncertain graphs, then provides privacy guarantee while maintaining data utility.
